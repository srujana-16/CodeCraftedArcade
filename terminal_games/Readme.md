- To play Rock, Paper and Scissors: run `python3 rock_paper_scissors.py` in your terminal.
- To play Tic Tac Toe: 
  - `cd` into the tic tac toe folder and run `python3 game.py`
- To play Hangman:
  - `cd` into the hangman folder and run `python3 hangman.py`
  
## Built with - Python 3

## Rock, Paper, Scissors
- Used `random.choice()` and basic functions and if statements. 

## Tic Tac Toe 
### Smart Computer Player
- A tic-tac-toe game where the computer never loses (or is a tie).
- This is the default mode of the game. 
- Utilized the minimax algorithm which is a recursive algorithm.
- Minimax is a kind of backtracking algorithm that is used in decision making and game theory to find the optimal move for a player. 
- In this algorithm, the two players are called maximizer and minimizer. The maximizer tries to get the highest score possible while the minimizer tries to do the opposite and get the lowest score possible.

### Random Computer Player 
- A tic-tac-toe game with various players in the command line. 
- The oppnents player `x_player` has to be changed to `RandomComputerPlayer('X')` in `game.py` to play this version of the game. 

## Hangman 
- Worked with dictionaries, lists, and nested if statements.
